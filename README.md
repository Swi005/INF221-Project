The INF221 Project- TBD

## Project Suggestions

1. EBNF with added semantic annotation w/ corresponding parser. The goal is that it should be able to generate a simple language with things like procedures, variables, and type system(??). The language would map its types to Haskell types.

2. EBNF parser that can generate syntax diagrams.
