# INF221-Project

The INF221 Project- TBD

## Project Suggestions

1. EBNF with added semantic annotation w/ corresponding parser. The goal is that it should be able to generate a simple language with things like procedures, variables, and type system(??). The language would map its types to Haskell types. Maybe map create a specification form for mapping syntax to existing Abstract Semantic.

2. EBNF parser that can generate syntax diagrams.

## Plan

1. Create EBNF Parser.
2. Design the semantic Model(ASR).
3. Design grammar for the semantic annotation.
4. Use the EBNF parser from (1) to generate the parser for (3).
5. Create a map from AST to ASR.
